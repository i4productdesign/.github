This repo is used to store  what github calls "Community Health Files": see https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file

These can include Code of Conduct, Funding, Security etc which maybe are not so relevant for us: but we can also use this repo to define common Templates (for Issues and for Pull Requests). See the .github folder.
